## DocPad Skeleton

A very basic boilerplate for [DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad) using [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/). So it's a responsive, mobile friendly development environment. CSS grid system and basic styles are baked in.

Clone this repo.

	git clone https://ckihneman@github.com/ckihneman/DocPad-Skeleton.git

Hop into the new folder that has been created and get DocPad fired up!

	cd DocPad-Skeleton

	docpad run

Yay! A new site.
